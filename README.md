Hi there! My name is Gabriel Sac Himelfarb and I'm a mathematician from Argentina. 
I did my Licenciatura Thesis (the Licenciatura is roughly equivalent to a Master's degree) under the guidance of Professor Ver√≥nica Becher.
The main results of my thesis are available here: https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2023-92-341/S0025-5718-2023-03806-6/home.html or https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03981.

I'm interested in discrete mathematical objects, such as de Bruijn graphs, Linear Feedback Shift Registers, etc. 
I'm currently working as a junior developer at Lambdaclass.
